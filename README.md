# words_and_thoughts
having fun with Rmarkdown Websites and Postcards
This repository is for the fruition from a hobby that turned into a passion. It all started as a way to keep myself accountable so I can continue to push myself and finish the books I start but never finish, So over the course of the year I have been generating content on instagram under the user @lost_in_a_tangent which started out as a way to share with others the books I read. In a way it is like a mini video journal of mine where I share my thoughts in a effort to promote discussion or shead insight onto ideas I myself never thought of before.
